### ⌈ ⚡️ Overview ⌋

Currently, I'm helping build the next generation of tools for the **Solana** ecosystem. My focus is on the intersection of product, design, and engineering—creating tools that aren't just functional, but meaningful to use. 🛠️

Previously, I was a core contributor to **Mango**, an open-source DeFi platform, and have collaborated with teams like **MetaDAO**, **Triton**, and **Vapi** to push the boundaries of decentralized products.
